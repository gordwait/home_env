 * Work out the frequency ratio restrictions of SPI(and I2C) relative to the reference clock. 
 * Fill in _ALL_ the registers in the register test routines.
 * Review I2C, how did I implement the endian switching in I2C again?
 * Why does HUDDemo need a manual reset? Startup reset not working?
 * Check Host Interface documentation, let Jimmy know about status
 * Finish current tests on HUD, let Jimmy know host interface change is done
 * Add more fctests to hud
 * finish trying to make 640x480 YUV tests run. 
 * continue to clean up patgen. 
 * Too many plls? 
 * Why does updating the pll model break the design?
 * Short plan to move all servers into the server room
 * Write up idea to build a linux desktop (red hat variant - yuck) as a template for asic designers to use.
 * Network password scheme for linux
 * DNS server?
 * Continue to document the patgencheck.
  * Which module controls the operating video settings?
 * run and update python tests for HUD on FPGA (now that burst mode is changed)

* List linux servers and tasks, plan to delist the unused/obsolete ones
* List of projects I'm on:
 * Coho/Hud current design
 * Coho/Hud Gentex Demo (Rev 2.0 Hud + YUV core, old register map)
 ** Includes it's own local copy of the patgen code. Grr... Lets fix that? Make the YUV an option?
 * Host Interface bug fix, and pass info to Jimmy when done (endian bug in SPI still there)
 * Maintain PatGen
 ** Move it to PatGenCheck GIT repo and "normalize"
 * Linux admin
 ** Update/Patch linux boxes
 * Look into network password scheme to replace the YP system 
 
* Skunkworks?
 * Get uCLinux running on Nios,
 * Use that as the base for the test generation including SPI/I2C commands
 * Things that bug me.
 * Sort out how to better manage eclipse projects along with git. 
 * Bugzilla or other simple bug tracker for hardware



* Done:
 * Monthly report
 * merge in Eric Lin's updates to the pattern generator
